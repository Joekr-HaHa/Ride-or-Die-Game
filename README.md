<b>Ride Or Die</b> – the game where your abilities are decided by a roll of the dice! 

You play as one of <b>3 characters</b>, using their <b>unique abilities</b> to traverse a warehouse swarming with enemies. Meet:
<ul>
<li><b>Dash</b> – a slippery character capable of performing short bursts of speed fast enough to propel himself through a wall;</li>

<li><b>Slugger</b> – a weaponry master who utilises his pistol to clear a safe path through the warehouse;</li>

<li><b>Dwayne</b> – a juggernaut able to lift heavy crates and throw them at walls, completely obliterating them!</li></ul>
